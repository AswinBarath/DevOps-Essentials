## Software Development Life Cycle

### What is Waterfall methodology?
-	Waterfall Model methodology which is also known as Liner Sequential Life Cycle Model. 
-	Waterfall Model is followed in a sequential order, so project development team only moves to next phase of development or testing if the previous step is completed successfully.
What is the Agile methodology?
-	Agile methodology is a practice that helps continuous iteration of development and testing in the software development process. 
-	In this model, development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike the Waterfall model. 
-	This process allows more communication between customers, developers, managers, and testers.

### Waterfall vs Agile Key Differences
-	Waterfall is a Liner Sequential Life Cycle Model whereas Agile is a continuous iteration of development and testing in the software development process.
-	In Agile vs Waterfall difference, the Agile methodology is known for its flexibility whereas Waterfall is a structured software development methodology.
-	Comparing the Waterfall methodology vs Agile which follows an incremental approach whereas the Waterfall is a sequential design process. 
-	Agile performs testing concurrently with software development whereas in Waterfall methodology testing comes after the “Build” phase.
-	Agile allows changes in project development requirement whereas Waterfall has no scope of changing the requirements once the project development starts.

### When to Use Agile vs. Waterfall
-	Waterfall is a more traditional approach to project management, involving a linear flow. 
-	Waterfall is best for projects with concrete timelines and well-defined deliverables. If your major project constraints are well understood and documented, Waterfall is likely the best approach.
-	Agile, on the other hand, embraces an iterative process. 
-	The Agile methodology was created for projects where the significant constraints are not well understood. If your project involves developing a new product, the scope and timeline may be difficult to determine in advance. Agile is flexible, enabling you to plan a project in stages or “sprints” to evolve as the work progresses.
